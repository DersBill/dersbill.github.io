      <p>As you may know, my name is Anders Bill and this is my website. </p></br>
      <p>  I wanted to build this site to grow out my programming skills </p></br>
      <p>  but also to share with you some of my latest writings, opinions </p></br>
      <p>  and my podcast. My two podcast channels, Failing Startup and </p></br>
      <p>  Startving Artist, allow me to talk to some of the most creative </p></br>
       <p> and daring artists and entrepreneurs. My guests are those who have </p></br>
      <p>  carved out a unique space in their relative field by pushing through </p></br>
      <p>  adversity and the headwinds that are often overwhleming in this </p></br>
      <p>  journey we call life. My hope is that fellow artists and entrepreneurs </p></br>
      <p>  can hear these stories and relate them to the challenges that face them. I can't </p></br>
      <p>  imagine that the stories told will make the challenges faced by others easier </p></br>
      <p>  to overcome, I can only hope that it is a comfort to know that they are not alone. </p></br>
      <p>  Both life paths require an unparraled aptitude to be gritty, but are also often </p></br>
      <p>  lonely. If you know any guests who have a story to tell, please, send me </p></br>
      <p> an email at anderscharlesbill@gmail.com! </p></br>
