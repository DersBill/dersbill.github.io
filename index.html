      <p>As you may know, my name is Anders Bill and this is my website.
     I wanted to build this site to grow out my programming skills
     but also to share with you some of my latest writings, opinions 
     and my podcast. My two podcast channels, Failing Startup and
       Startving Artist, allow me to talk to some of the most creative
        and daring artists and entrepreneurs. My guests are those who have
     carved out a unique space in their relative field by pushing through
       adversity and the headwinds that are often overwhleming in this
   journey we call life. My hope is that fellow artists and entrepreneurs
      can hear these stories and relate them to the challenges that face them. I can't
     imagine that the stories told will make the challenges faced by others easier
     to overcome, I can only hope that it is a comfort to know that they are not alone.
        Both life paths require an unparraled aptitude to be gritty, but are also often
       lonely. If you know any guests who have a story to tell, please, send me
    an email at anderscharlesbill@gmail.com!
